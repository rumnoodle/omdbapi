# Omdb API Movie Search

## Setup

You'll need a secret key from http://www.omdbapi.com to be able to use this search. When you have that paste it into the correct place in server.js to be able to make searches. (In production this would be stored somewhere else like a vault, environment variable etc.)

When you've added the key the application can be installed and run on development with the following commands.

* `npm i`
* `cd client`
* `npm i`
* `cd ..`
* `npm start`

Navigate to localhost:3000 to try it out unless it is opened automatically.

## Testing

To test the application go into client folder and run `npm test`.
